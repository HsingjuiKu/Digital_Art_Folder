The inspiration of this work comes from this ancient poem, which demonstrates the basic concepts of materialism and idealism. 
In the author's opinion, any extreme view will lead to the deviation of looking at the problem. 
In my works, I use the circle to represent idealism, and the square to represent materialism. 
The whole figure will continue to cycle, from materialism to idealism, and then from idealism to materialism.
Whether the circle covers the square or the square covers the circle, it will lead to adding a cognitive framework to myself. 
Only by constantly exploring cognition can we look at problems and the world more clearly and rationally.
In the code, I used to build a square class to complete the work, and gave it a change function to realize it. Please see the code for details.
